### Duskspire

* midsized city, butting up against a mountain range and surrounded by forest

    * quite a few shops, houses, taverns, etc.
  * inner wall is much taller stone, with a small moat outside of it, usually open during the day
* started as a place to study the local leylines
  * an ancient monarch recognized its value and started the school construction
    * saw it as reflecting well on his domain
    * thought having the best magic users would be good
    * with the direct patronage from the ruler, it also became more directly beholden to him as well

    * more of a general adventuring guild
    * they accept and dispense contracts to hunt beasts
    * there are also some standing contracts for beasts that are considered too dangerous
    * also a good place to check for simpler magical items or looking for stuff
  * at this point the guild is considered a very reputable, good part of the city
  * they also run a number of stores

### Talsworth

* distortions and cracks in reality
  * The Shattering - 7-8 years ago
* is mostly abandoned

  * the woods around the town are dark and overgrown and full of dark energy
  * surrounded by blights

# Characters

## Players

* Anno Quickdream the halfling rogue
  * basically Robin Hood
  * never knew their parents
  * lived with a friend
    * got caught stealing and the parents took the blame and were taken away
    * was teaching the friend how to be a rogue as well
* Sylvester the tabaxi bard
  * flute = ocarina
  * upon gaining one of their special skills will have some sort of physical change
    * if they want to keep it hidden then have to occasionally do wisdom? throws vs others' perception checks
  * mini bag of holding
  * is own deity
  * realm is called Threshot
  * Meredith is the one who sent him on this quest. He doesn't like her.
  * racial notes
    * are formed, not born
    * the first ones coalesced from the roiling chaos
    * these then shaped that energy into others, putting part of their own energy into their offspring
      * parents therefore have an innate connection to those they form and at least know if they still exist
    * Meredith is likely one of the first ones
      * alternately, she could be the cautionary tale of having too many parents, giving her too much power as she never matured properly since no one could oppose her
    * Sylvester likely formed naturally, the first in thousands of years
      * had no contact for hundreds of years
      * eventually tried to create a friend, which was likely successful (it takes many years for someone to come to consciousness after being formed, so Sylvester would spend his time watching over this glowing ball of energy)
      * After a while Meredith and others took friend
        * they felt that something was different and that it would usher in great change
        * Sylvester can tell from his life force that friend still lives, but has no idea where or how they are
        * he was never given a proper explanation, as Meredith felt no need to answer to him
    * form reacts to planar energy, eg, fire plane causes him to become a shaggier dark red, water would be finer fur with a slight blue tint and sheen, etc
* Reyna the elven druid
  * Abandoned? at a young age
  * Told to keep her heritage a secret
  * Vaguely remembers a location, not sure if if was her home or some dream/vision she had
  * Raised by a gnome druid who then passed away
    * Highly attached to the forest where she was raised
  * Likes to people watch, but not great socially
  * Only knows broken elvish
  * her name is an elven child's name, may come up when interacting with other elves
