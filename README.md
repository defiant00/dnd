### Archdale

* named optimistically

  * should be working with another race (dragonborn?) to build some sort of magical engine at this nexus

# Characters

## Players

* Anno Quickdream the halfling rogue
  * basically Robin Hood
  * never knew their parents
  * lived with a friend - Linera Freewind
    * got caught stealing and the parents took the blame and were taken away - Vinlor and Yessira Freewind
    * was teaching Linera how to be a rogue as well
  * town is named Moonrest, neighboring town that they would steal from is Archdale
* Sylvester the tabaxi bard

  * mini bag of holding
  * is own deity
  * realm is called Threshot
  * Meredith is the one who sent him on this quest. He doesn't like her.
  * racial notes
    * are formed, not born
    * the first ones coalesced from the roiling chaos
    * these then shaped that energy into others, putting part of their own energy into their offspring
      * parents therefore have an innate connection to those they form and at least know if they still exist
    * Meredith is likely one of the first ones
      * alternately, she could be the cautionary tale of having too many parents, giving her too much power as she never matured properly since no one could oppose her
    * Sylvester likely formed naturally, the first in thousands of years
      * had no contact for hundreds of years
      * eventually tried to create a friend, which was likely successful (it takes many years for someone to come to consciousness after being formed, so Sylvester would spend his time watching over this glowing ball of energy)
      * After a while Meredith and others took friend
        * they felt that something was different and that it would usher in great change
        * Sylvester can tell from his life force that friend still lives, but has no idea where or how they are
        * he was never given a proper explanation, as Meredith felt no need to answer to him
    * form reacts to planar energy, eg, fire plane causes him to become a shaggier dark red, water would be finer fur with a slight blue tint and sheen, etc
* Reyna the elven druid
  * Abandoned? at a young age
  * Told to keep her heritage a secret
  * Vaguely remembers a location, not sure if if was her home or some dream/vision she had
  * Raised by a gnome druid who then passed away

  * getting rid of the corpses should help

* Matthew and Germain are returning to Duskspire, the party is welcome to join them if they want

  * explain that there have been four nexus points up until recently

      * Falanor and Nurimor, once the crown of our civilization, ancient twin elven cities
        * wiped out 400+ years ago, Mylaela should be somewhat nostalgic

      * the shattering seems to have caused ripples throughout the leylines themselves
      * some have shifted and tangled
      * fortunately the other three stayed in place, but this lead to a lessening at Talsworth, and the formation of the one at the Emerald Depths
  * there is now a fifth at the Emerald Depths
    * deep in the ocean, a growing number of druids have gone there to help setting up the runes necessary to be able to live at that depth
  * the council has received no ill word from Emberhold or the Emerald Depths, but it would be good to send an expert on rift energy to check those locations and the Felspring

  * the passageway should be a dead end, but Nalsora just grabs the stone and pulls it aside like a door, forming a staircase
  * if the players are considered hostile, they should be entangled

## Emberhold To Do

large rock dome, reddish rock with orange crystals embedded that faintly glow
layered rings, goes from shops/taverns/businesses to residential and storage
in the center is a large rock platform anchored to the ceiling with four huge chains
  has a number of trees and a pond on it, along with an open building that is used for formal business
  when not being used for formal business it's effectively a park
  above is a large circular opening that lets in sunlight/air/weather, with a few trees and bushes growing out of the side
off around to the right is the research lab
the nexus point is deep underground
there's been reports of weird creatures, so they're putting together a group to go investigate
  they're currently stretched a bit thin between this and some bandits that have been causing trouble
  however, since Nil needs to get to the nexus point the party can wait or escort them themselves
    they can also offer a few helpful magic items if the party is willing to test them
      these should be magic crystal-powered, but have failure states that aren't on their item cards, such as shattering on a 1
also, previously Nil discharged some of the batteries, but upon further experimentation they found that they now behave
  differently/better? so they want Nil to do that to a number more to see if the same thing occurs
follow the pipes to the nexus point
they're currently working on an elevator straight to the nexus point, but it's unfinished
possibly some sort of magically warped cordyceps mushrooms that are taking over some of the cave beasts
  given a few magic potions specifically to counter magic exposure if they go in on their own

approach the gate, guard holds up hand and talks a minute then when recognizing Nil lets them through
  "sorry, can't be too cautious these days"
as you enter you see the above
  there are patterns on the walls, that as you then walk closer you see it's a layer of metal pipes
after a minute two dragonborn approach
  dark green older female dragonborn leading the way, **Mishann Galthinshtas**
    gray robes trimmed in silver
    silver framed spectacles
  copper young male dragonborn, **Narvull Delrasondur**
    simple blue robe thrown over a simple shirt and shorts
    has a belt with a number of pouches where he keeps his tools
Narvull immediately comes up and gushes a bit, assuming the party is the council at the start
  "Counciperson Nil, High Councilwoman Mylaela, ..."
  Mishann corrects him after a moment and apologizes for the confusion
they talk with Nil about the purpose of the visit, and then ask if they can have their help before
  you embark towards the nexus point
walk to the lab
Mishann explains that the batteries Nil expelled hold less charge, but are much more stable
  the natural crystals shatter when overloaded or too quickly discharged
go into one of the main lab rooms, with a number of others in it (number of dragonborn and 2 dwarves)
bring out a number of crystals and ask Nil to discharge them
  Nil should be able to for those with planar energy, and apologize for not being able to for the others
    if they're either uncharged or charged with normal magic
they thank everyone, and say they won't take up more of your time
explain that the party can ride the elevator partway down, but construction has stalled due to the weird
  occurrences having people spooked - some sort of magically reactive fungus?
as they're getting ready to go, Narvull says he's been working on some things if they'd like to see,
  and maybe try it out if they're willing? you can see Mishann humor him with a bit of a tired smile
the dwarf **Harram Lanhegan** comes with you all
led to a smaller room that is 90% workshop with a small, neatly made, cot in a corner
everything is precisely in its place, crystal shards organized by shape and size, tools neatly placed and labeled
explains that he is given extra bits to experiment with, working on making smaller, portable devices
  so even those without magic can use some in a convenient, portable way that is much easier to create than
  a traditional enchantment
as he's taking out a number of items, Harram explains that he's been helping. the others have doubts, but he
  thinks Narvull is on to something
Narvull, "I have a number of things I've been working on. You're welcome to try them out on your trip to the
  nexus point, just try to bring them back and let me know how they do?"
as you're examining some of the items, Harram laments the craftsmanship (which is fine) and says they've been
  trying to get the blacksmiths from Duskspire to join them. Bergrom's a fine blacksmith, and have you seen
  the detail work that his husband does? This would be right up his alley.
  But unfortunately I haven't been able to convince them yet.
party then leaves after choosing what they'd like to try out
  can ride the elevator or go from the top
going through, the caves are rough, with pipes along the sides
  mostly the same reddish rock with various layers/stripes of reds to grays
  orange/red crystals with a faint glow
  occasional lava flows
past where the elevator goes there starts to be magical mushrooms and lichen/growth along some of the walls/floor/etc
  noticeably cooler around these, as they seem to feed off of the heat
  constitution saving throw for spores
items
  gas masks
  charging orb (absorbs heat, can charge other crystals in proximity)
  razor dagger (vibrates)
  flaming arrow attachment
  kinetic gloves
  2x light stone
  flow cloak
  belt of returning

shriekers
  gas spore
  violet fungus

ankheg
behir
bulette
darkmantle
grick
hook horror
kobold
friendly myconids
piercer + roper

Reldis and Twil from the northern colony
  Reldis is cloaked and hooded, with a staff
  Twil is large (mid-sized dog?) and has a number of smaller glowing mushrooms on it as well
  if having difficulty with the Hooked Horrors, they should show up with a wave of spores
  after walking a while come across all surfaces coated with blue-green slightly glowing mushrooms
  Reldis calls out to them, "hey friends, this way"
  "did you see any of the mushrooms on the way in?"
  "I should take care of those...fortunately they don't move very fast on their own...ha ha...sorry, mushroom joke"
  spores from Twil + wind cantrip to move them along and cause them to wither
  shows them the behir, explains they've been tracking it
    we must take care of it before it's so far gone that it ignores the other mushrooms

skills
  heal / cure the infection (dark grey lichen)
  spore gust


**Kairn** the dwarven captain of the guard, with a runic hammer and full plate armor watches the party
when they wake up and have breakfast, then approaches them
"So, I understand we have a creature to slay. Will you be joining us?"
if the party agrees, go to the central area and meet with Mishann, Reldis, Narvull
  when should we go?
  how many people?
  do you need to go shopping first?
  give healing necklaces to the party
    has 3 charges, as a bonus action can use 1+ charges to heal 1d4 + 2 per charge
names: Chert, Urissa, Rainth, Elcor

large cavern clawed out of the rock
small passageway and room before it stoneshaped into the rock, and then a tunnel curving around, that comes
  out 15 feet above into a small stone ledge jutting out
there are then other tunnels that connect to 3 more small ledges, and there are some vine bridges between a few
one set of vine bridges is broken
going to the first ledge, there is a large tunnel torn through the small one, making it difficult to get there
the large tunnel is 20-30 feet long angling downward
there are a number of mushrooms spread throughout, and a number of mounds of dead beasts coated in mushrooms
  some of the mushrooms will set off like a trap, either emitting spores or shrieking

during battle, Nil rolls per attack as long as they feel safe, 15+ saves against an attack on an ally, but they
  have to make a dc10 constitution saving throw or they get sick (disadvantage on next attack)

infection
  3 - dc10 constitution save, on fail you lose your action
  6 - above + take 1d4 damage at the start of your turn
  9 - above + take 1d8 damage at the start of your turn


more spores and mushrooms the farther in you go
more pipes joining in along the ceiling
a broken pipe venting steam - a chunk of metal that was torn off, and a small pool along the other side
  some mushroom traps - duck should get nervous around them
at the end is a metal door and a metal automaton
a few corpses of creatures (hook horror, a couple other)
if open the door before, then they will lurch forward and try and get to the nexus point
  they fuse together into a weird flesh/mushroom abomination

## Felspring To Do

* on the way / barely into the area, during a long rest Reyna should wake up with a wraith just standing there watching her
* the wraiths in general don't react much, but do seem to occasionally watch Reyna

# Plot Points

* met wolf while fighting bears in the jackalwere cave
* Duskspire is tracking odd, possibly demonic energy
  * has been going on for about a year
* Duskspire regularly checks back on Talsworth and marks the new boundaries
  * typically sends Oakenbeard
  * they have large stakes topped with pale blue crystals that glow when rift energy is present
  * check up on the town every six months and mark the new boundaries
    * so there are stakes a good halfway into the town and then they stop
    * the area affected is slowly growing
  * the crystals react to rift energy, glowing and possibly even sparking or shattering if it's too great
  * there are two main types of stakes, those Oakenbeard brings, and those from the centaur herd
  * Eyl'teria oversees the area as well and is on good terms with Oakenbeard, calls him Rommeas
* Who summoned the Spectator to prevent the rift from being barriered?

* Anno has the recruitment dagger from Germain for the Duskspire thieves' guild
  * has "Truth in Shadow" on the guard in thieves cant

* potentially long term Oakenbeard shows back up but is different
  * may be latched on to by some powerful entity, and he's holding it back for now
  * goal of getting it out of him and fighting it?

* Nil is friend
* Nil getting kicked out of chaos caused the shattering
  * they currently don't know this
  * the council wanted to keep an eye on them, and think that they may not be at fault
    * no bodies were found at Talsworth
      * Nil saved them all, but most of the conflict is a blur to them, and the council
      has reinforced that they're misremembering about even being around for the shattering
    * the council believes that everyone may still be alive, perhaps in another plane?
    * finding the population of Talsworth is one of the long-term goals

after Emberhold, Nil should teleport the party individually through their pocket dimension to see if
  one of them is the cause for the prior response
  offer each member tea/snacks and talk for a minute to see if anything reacts
    Sylvester last
  previously had one curtained window and no outer doors, but this time there is a single door
    that they lead each member through as a more permanent connection to Duskspire
  when Sylvester is in there, after a few minutes the same attention is felt
    wisdom saving throw to detect if hostile (it isn't)
      if Sylvester panics and they leave, their fight-or-flight while in chaos results in them being wreathed in shadows
        and their third eye opening (perception check from the rest of the party)
    knocks on the door
    humanoid wreathed in shadow
      is revealed as being from Talsworth, the shadow then flowing off of them revealing the person

after Emberhold the ettercap infestation should be getting people at Brookhaven sick
  Nil probably wants to come help (and meet Arthur?)
    may be advised that tieflings are mistrusted
      in preparation should walk around Sylvester going "hmm..." and "uh huh..."
      should then show up the next day as a light tan tabaxi with patterns on the top of their head that suggest horns
Reyna's ruby enchanted weirdly, they give half the gold back but offer to buy the ruby off of her
  fire resistance when it doesn't have a charge, but when that works it absorbs half the energy
    and you must use an action to discharge it or apply it to an attack
Nil's pocket dimension is a simple set of four rooms in a square
  one is a sitting room
  one for food that is magically frozen in time
    if anyone touches the food they freeze as well
  one is for their money and treasures
  any windows should be curtained, but look out into a void
  if they invite the party in, after a bit the subsonic hum that you didn't previously notice suddenly stops,
    and in that silence suddenly the whole space lurches and Nil gets everyone out (possibly Merideth or someone she sent)
eventual confrontation with Merideth
  silent Akira explosion, that then expands pulling everything into it with a loud rushing wind
  right before the party is pulled in the wind is deafening, and then darkness and silence
  "Sylvester" whispered out menacingly
  everyone make a sanity saving throw
  Sylvester's normal abilities don't work (like, can't cast at all, not just ineffective against her), but after a moment realizes
    that he has shifted to his full chaos form (with all new abilities)
eventual Nil reveal, "Don't you remember me...(Sylvester's true name)"
  if Nil hasn't revealed before the confrontation with Meredith above, when Sylvester is finding all
    his skills don't work, suddenly should be teleported to Nil's room for just a second and Nil
    should reveal themself as friend, and give Sylvester back some of the power that originally formed
    them, "here, I've cultivated this power that you used to form me..." and they then look drained but
    okay, resulting in Sylvester getting the whole new set of skills for the fight
      Sylvester should possibly get all the powers that Nil's demonstrated throughout the campaign, but stronger?
