              Oswyn : ?
              Neon
                was detected as a demonic entity
                blame it on the shard city with all its weird energy
              Eva : ?
            lore / helper npc
              you've been imprisoned
              they've been hunting some sort of demonic entity
                very dangerous

                may confront later in the campaign
          events
            all players roll, saving throw?
            highest wakes up first, or just let oswyn start
              others can be checked on
              might wake up on their own, more saving throws?
            woken up by a distant explosion
            after going through the first couple rooms with very little resistance, perhaps guards left or just let you through, encounter a room with a large hole blown into the wall
      shard city
        distortions and cracks in reality
        is mostly abandoned
        some views into the past, some to other planes
        possibly where Neon showed up
        good place for an eventual showdown
      Duskspire
        named optimistically
        founded by a rich family deep into the arts
        famous music school
        most everything else dried up, so it's now just a small town supporting the school
      frog sanctuary
      a temple that has a pet turtle
