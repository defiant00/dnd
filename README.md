# Characters

## Players

* Anno Quickdream the halfling rogue
  * basically Robin Hood
  * never knew their parents
  * lived with a friend
    * got caught stealing and the parents took the blame and were taken away
    * was teaching the friend how to be a rogue as well
* Sylvester the tabaxi bard
  * flute = ocarina
  * upon gaining one of their special skills will have some sort of physical change
    * if they want to keep it hidden then have to occasionally do wisdom? throws vs others' perception checks
  * mini bag of holding
  * is own deity
  * realm is called Threshot
  * Meredith is the one who sent him on this quest. He doesn't like her.
  * racial notes
    * are formed, not born
    * the first ones coalesced from the roiling chaos
    * these then shaped that energy into others, putting part of their own energy into their offspring
      * parents therefore have an innate connection to those they form and at least know if they still exist
    * Meredith is likely one of the first ones
      * alternately, she could be the cautionary tale of having too many parents, giving her too much power as she never matured properly since no one could oppose her
    * Sylvester likely formed naturally, the first in thousands of years
      * had no contact for hundreds of years
      * eventually tried to create a friend, which was likely successful (it takes many years for someone to come to consciousness after being formed, so Sylvester would spend his time watching over this glowing ball of energy)
      * After a while Meredith and others took friend
        * they felt that something was different and that it would usher in great change
        * Sylvester can tell from his life force that friend still lives, but has no idea where or how they are
        * he was never given a proper explanation, as Meredith felt no need to answer to him
    * form reacts to planar energy, eg, fire plane causes him to become a shaggier dark red, water would be finer fur with a slight blue tint and sheen, etc
* Reyna the elven druid
  * Abandoned? at a young age
  * Told to keep her heritage a secret
  * Vaguely remembers a location, not sure if if was her home or some dream/vision she had
  * Raised by a gnome druid who then passed away
    * Highly attached to the forest where she was raised
  * Likes to people watch, but not great socially
  * Only knows broken elvish
  * her name is an elven child's name, may come up when interacting with other elves

# To Do

* for the current battle, after the first is finished, Germain should distract the 3rd then jump out of the way so Oakenbeard can "fall" him (which splits the sky)

* Anno asked the leatherworker to make them something from the bear skin. Will take a few days between other jobs, and can then be picked up and taken to Averitt's.
* Averitt will have his anvil back (and is excited), and will be happy to practice for a reduced fee (or probably free if it's mentioned that they got the anvil back).
  * Will take a few more days to attach metal bands to it.
  * Is eventually an AC + 1 bracer.

* if exploring the crops dying, going upstream finds a split, one way which eventually leads to a lake, and the other continues on as a river
  * the river side eventually is about halfway blocked off with a large pile of animal corpses, broken logs, etc
  * lots of spider webs and such, also wrapped around the debris in the river
  * getting rid of the corpses should help
  * a swarm of Ettercaps are responsible

* Rowan can suggest that the party can help him patrol the forest
  * he's been meaning to do so for a while, but can't due to a lack of manpower
* job board
  * someone needs wolf pelts
  * farmers need help clearing the land for a new field
    * they're nervous with what's been going on recently
    * can help out with the actual farming
    * also there to guard
      * attacked by a roving goblin band, possibly including a worg or rider
  * kids wants to learn how to play music
  * Averitt has a general ad for his blacksmithing, more of an, "I'm learning, please bring me jobs"

## Talsworth To Do

* the two doppelgangers are following the party, looking for opportunities to switch out with any of them

* make the rounds and mark the latest area
* some of the markers are of different make, from the centaur herd (smoky red crystals instead of pale blue)
* meet Eyl'teria
  * first greets Oakenbeard as "Rommeas", acknowledges Matthew and Germain, then turns to the party
  * she greets each of the party with, "And you...who are you?" or "What is your purpose?" along with a psychic whisper that only the member can hear
    * Sylvester hears "aberration"
    * Reyna hears "tainted one," and an overlapping whisper of "marked"
      * if asked what they meant, only say, "that is a thread that is best left alone"
    * Anno does not hear anything
  * "The expansion continues. The rift grows more active by the day. Take care in your approach."
* Lapis and Nutmeg playing pranks on the party, but also showing where dangerous portals are
  * throw small things at the party, and they can bounce off and disappear through a distortion
  * see small paths of fairy dust appear and then poof in front of a distortion
  * doors or windows slam to stop them from walking into one
  * gusts of wind blowing debris around
  * minor illusions
    * Anno - duck(s) that then revert, folding themselves back into an egg
    * Reyna - nature turning to dust, which takes the form of abominations
    * Sylvester - nothingness, with the sense of faraway beings of great power
* portals - have to make a saving throw to not stumble and fall and/or freak out and run?
  * elemental - sensations but no damage, disorientating
  * shadow - emptiness with far off obelisks trailing shadow
  * chaos - incomprehensible kaleidiscope for the senses, perception/insight? to see if you notice something powerful noticing you
* after a bit of investigation and combat? a large distortion should temporarily claim Oakenbeard
* doppelganger takes this opportunity after a minute or two to show up as Oakenbeard
  * Germain and/or Matthew might notice it's not him and attack or restrain him
  * alternately, replacing Oakenbeard would be a huge accomplishment
* Oakenbeard is unlikely to return in the next few sessions
* should probably get the party to come with them to Duskspire to figure out what to do next

# Plot Points

* met wolf while fighting bears in the jackalwere cave
* Duskspire is tracking odd, possibly demonic energy
  * has been going on for about a year
* Duskspire regularly checks back on Talsworth and marks the new boundaries
  * typically sends Oakenbeard
  * they have large stakes topped with pale blue crystals that glow when rift energy is present
  * check up on the town every six months and mark the new boundaries
    * so there are stakes a good halfway into the town and then they stop
    * the area affected is slowly growing
  * the crystals react to rift energy, glowing and possibly even sparking or shattering if it's too great
  * there are two main types of stakes, those Oakenbeard brings, and those from the centaur herd
  * Eyl'teria oversees the area as well and is on good terms with Oakenbeard, calls him Rommeas
