# Locations of Eldorin

## The Continent of Vaelesta

### Archdale

* named optimistically
* founded by a rich family deep into the arts

* no one seems to know for sure what happened here, but a number of religions claim that this was the result of their deity defeating some great evil
* there is a large dwarven city carved into the mountains here
  * should be working with another race (dragonborn?) to build some sort of magical engine at this nexus

### Duskspire

* midsized city, butting up against a mountain range and surrounded by forest
* mountains mainly to the east, so at dusk the city and backing mountains are lit in brilliant colors
* two layers of walls
  * outer wall is stone, not too high, and open to all most of the time
    * quite a few shops, houses, taverns, etc.
  * inner wall is much taller stone, with a small moat outside of it, usually open during the day
* started as a place to study the local leylines
  * an ancient monarch recognized its value and started the school construction
    * saw it as reflecting well on his domain
    * thought having the best magic users would be good

  * there is a large guild hall in the outer city
    * they accept and dispense contracts to hunt beasts
    * there are also some standing contracts for beasts that are considered too dangerous
    * also a good place to check for simpler magical items or looking for stuff

# Characters

## Players

* Anno Quickdream the halfling rogue
  * basically Robin Hood
  * never knew their parents
  * lived with a friend
    * got caught stealing and the parents took the blame and were taken away
    * was teaching the friend how to be a rogue as well
* Sylvester the tabaxi bard
  * flute = ocarina
  * upon gaining one of their special skills will have some sort of physical change
    * if they want to keep it hidden then have to occasionally do wisdom? throws vs others' perception checks
  * mini bag of holding
  * is own deity
  * realm is called Threshot
  * Meredith is the one who sent him on this quest. He doesn't like her.
  * racial notes
    * are formed, not born
    * the first ones coalesced from the roiling chaos
    * these then shaped that energy into others, putting part of their own energy into their offspring
      * parents therefore have an innate connection to those they form and at least know if they still exist
    * Meredith is likely one of the first ones
      * alternately, she could be the cautionary tale of having too many parents, giving her too much power as she never matured properly since no one could oppose her
    * Sylvester likely formed naturally, the first in thousands of years
      * had no contact for hundreds of years
      * eventually tried to create a friend, which was likely successful (it takes many years for someone to come to consciousness after being formed, so Sylvester would spend his time watching over this glowing ball of energy)
      * After a while Meredith and others took friend
        * they felt that something was different and that it would usher in great change
        * Sylvester can tell from his life force that friend still lives, but has no idea where or how they are
        * he was never given a proper explanation, as Meredith felt no need to answer to him
    * form reacts to planar energy, eg, fire plane causes him to become a shaggier dark red, water would be finer fur with a slight blue tint and sheen, etc
* Reyna the elven druid
  * Abandoned? at a young age
  * Told to keep her heritage a secret
  * Vaguely remembers a location, not sure if if was her home or some dream/vision she had
  * Raised by a gnome druid who then passed away
    * Highly attached to the forest where she was raised
  * Likes to people watch, but not great socially
  * Only knows broken elvish
  * her name is an elven child's name, may come up when interacting with other elves

    * Sylvester - grows to be a few inches shorter than him, greets, and gives him a copper (and refuses to elaborate)
    * Reyna - greets, looks for a second then plucks the ruby from the air, lets the energy free with a "there you go little one" and returns it
      * ruby has been changed from the energy and would make an excellent focus
  * says that they need to look into things, and will see them again in a day or two
    * "that is troubling news. we'll need to check in on the other nexus points"
    * Germain and Matthew are asked to stay behind

    * the one in the Felspring within the Greensway
      * Falanor and Nurimor, once the crown of our civilization, ancient twin elven cities
        * wiped out 400+ years ago, Mylaela should be somewhat nostalgic
    * Talsworth
      * don't worry, they're going to send a group to reinforce the barrier
      * the shattering seems to have caused ripples throughout the leylines themselves
      * some have shifted and tangled
      * fortunately the other three stayed in place, but this lead to a lessening at Talsworth, and the formation of the one at the Emerald Depths
  * there is now a fifth at the Emerald Depths
    * deep in the ocean, a growing number of druids have gone there to help setting up the runes necessary to be able to live at that depth
  * the council has received no ill word from Emberhold or the Emerald Depths, but it would be good to send an expert on rift energy to check those locations and the Felspring

    * Matthew and Germain have other business to attend to
      * Matthew wants to do more research and direct the search here

    * there are a few levers hidden throughout that open the bars
    * also getting judged on if you attack or try to stealth
    * a number of things (coin, few bits of equipment, etc) strewn in corners, on the ground, and in the river
    * meet Nalsora here if it starts going badly or if they get all levers then she'll enter from the now unblocked passage
  * the passageway should be a dead end, but Nalsora just grabs the stone and pulls it aside like a door, forming a staircase
  * if the players are considered hostile, they should be entangled

## Felspring To Do

* on the way / barely into the area, during a long rest Reyna should wake up with a wraith just standing there watching her
* the wraiths in general don't react much, but do seem to occasionally watch Reyna

# Plot Points

* met wolf while fighting bears in the jackalwere cave
* Duskspire is tracking odd, possibly demonic energy
  * has been going on for about a year
* Duskspire regularly checks back on Talsworth and marks the new boundaries
  * typically sends Oakenbeard
  * they have large stakes topped with pale blue crystals that glow when rift energy is present
  * check up on the town every six months and mark the new boundaries
    * so there are stakes a good halfway into the town and then they stop
    * the area affected is slowly growing
  * the crystals react to rift energy, glowing and possibly even sparking or shattering if it's too great
  * there are two main types of stakes, those Oakenbeard brings, and those from the centaur herd
  * Eyl'teria oversees the area as well and is on good terms with Oakenbeard, calls him Rommeas
* Who summoned the Spectator to prevent the rift from being barriered?

* Anno has the recruitment dagger from Germain for the Duskspire thieves' guild
  * has "Truth in Shadow" on the guard in thieves cant

* potentially long term Oakenbeard shows back up but is different
  * may be latched on to by some powerful entity, and he's holding it back for now
  * goal of getting it out of him and fighting it?

* Nil is friend
* Nil getting kicked out of chaos caused the shattering

* came back to town and told Floria about the bears, so the town will come and get them
* Anno took the bear pelt to the same lady who wanted wolf pelts and asked her to make a gauntlet/sleeve with it
  * was told it would take a while, but since she doesn't normally work with bear it would be free since it would probably be rough
  * will finish her part and then check with Averitt to see if he can affix some strips of iron across it for better defense
* leveled up that evening

## Session 4

* Reyna asked Arthur about seeing some baby animals (Easter!)
  * Arthur mentions baby chicks and ducks, but most of that is for a later town festival involving the children and baby animals
