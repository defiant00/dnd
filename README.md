## To Do

* start off in the evening and visit the Soggy Bottom
* next day
  * Sylvester teaches the kids, performance check for pulling out the instrument
    * performance check for a demo
    * these determine how excited the kids then are, and possibly give advantage to the teaching attempt
  * Anno, duck?
    * a few like Arthur should know that some of the farmers have chickens and some have ducks
    * should be a little gag of everyone directing him to someone else
    * Glenn -> Ellie -> Brice -> Harold + Gertrude
      * Harold: "Honey, do we have any ducks?"
      * "What?"
      * "Ducks!"
      * "They're not ready yet, they're still just ducklings"
  * Reyna?

* if exploring the crops dying, going upstream finds a split, one way which eventually leads to a lake, and the other continues on as a river
  * the river side eventually is about halfway blocked off with a large pile of animal corpses, broken logs, etc
  * there is some sort of (not recently used) cave or other rough nest or living quarters
  * getting rid of the corpses should help

* Oakenbeard shows up with a couple others traveling with him
  * Sylvester is immediately on edge, if insightful enough might realize that he completely sees through him but doesn't seem hostile
    * Sylvester should have all his hair stand on end, has to roll to see if he can approach
    * if hidden, Oakenbeard should be, "Come on out, little one"
      * should call Sylvester "little one" in general
    * "and who are you, little one?"
    * "and why are you here?"
  * if anyone tries to investigate / detect magic, he humors them and gives them a couple seconds before canceling the spell
    * a small smile, as if to say, "let's not be rude now"
* Elluin is trying to seem important and exaggerate his contributions by saying "we did this"
  * does the whole "we found this" and has the jackalwere dumped out of a cart onto the ground
* Oakenbeard is unimpressed
* if checking out the prism stone, will take out his silver bell as he examines it
  * any magical emission from the stone should cause a glow from the bell
  * also a smaller reaction from the stakes that both helpers are carrying

* there's a few instances of thieves' cant around town
  * a couple with general directions of "seek the storehouse with a red roof"
  * the storehouse should have a small "here"
  * trapdoor into the basement
    * locked (purposefully simple as a test)
  * leads into a storage room, and what looks to be a new tunnel and the start of what will eventually be a meeting room
    * some sort of simple nonlethal trap in the entrance of the storage room
  * have a few items including Averitt's anvil down there, probably taken as an entrance test
  * should be walked in on by Derek, who quickly realizes he's outclassed
    * the anvil was taken by one of the other new members
    * Derek wants to return it but doesn't know how without arousing suspicion, also he'd need help because it's heavy
    * asks the party to help return it, and not mention his involvement

* Rowan can suggest that the party can help him patrol the forest
  * he's been meaning to do so for a while, but can't due to a lack of manpower
* job board
  * someone needs wolf pelts
    * if they take this one on, the boar at the river has been eaten and one of the wolves has been dragged off
      * dragged off by a bear (or two?) at a cave or similar
      * a wolf should come to help them
      * maybe possibly a wolf friend
  * farmers need help clearing the land for a new field
    * they're nervous with what's been going on recently
    * can help out with the actual farming
    * also there to guard
      * attacked by a roving goblin band, possibly including a worg or rider
  * someone wants to learn how to play music
  * someone wants their fields to be checked for curses?
    * probably a natural cause to their low crop yield
  * someone is missing a donkey
    * this is more of an investigation
    * was just cut free as part of the recent goblin thing
    * wandered off into the woods and got caught up in a hunting snare
  * Averitt wants an anvil (or something functionally equivalent)
    * doesn't have money, but can fix and make simple things in trade
    * is apologetic and downplays his skills, but has a few things he made with the rock that're actually pretty good

## Plot Points

* Duskspire is tracking odd, possibly demonic energy
* Duskspire regularly checks back on Talsworth and marks the new boundaries
  * Typically sends Oakenbeard
  * they have large stakes topped with pale blue crystals that glow when rift energy is present
  * check up on the town every few months? and mark the new boundaries
    * so there are stakes a good halfway into the town and then they stop
    * the area affected is slowly growing
  * the crystals react to rift energy, glowing and possibly even sparking or shattering if it's too great

  * Anno went investigating the woods, following the stream in search of a duck
    * got one rough wolf pelt
    * followed the drag marks and almost got attacked by a bear, but climbed a tree and hid
  * Sylvester played some music in the square and took on the job to teach some kids music
    * will be meeting in the morning at the square
  * Reyna investigated a field that isn't growing well and recommended burning part of it and replanting
    * also brought the box, thinking the dirt might be related to the soil being bad
    * checked out the rock inside with Rowan there just in case
    * saw it do fire, water, and wind, faint whispering, and being prismatic
    * currently keeping ahold of the rock
  * waiting for the messenger from Duskspire to show up in a couple days
